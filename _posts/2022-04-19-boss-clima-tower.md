      BoSS mobile aluminium towers are light-weight scaffold towers used throughout the building and

      construction industry for both indoor and outdoor access solutions, where a stable and secure

      platform is required. Ideal for maintenance and installation work or short-term access, the highly

      versatile towers provide a strong working platform for a variety of heights.



      This User Guide provides you with step by step instructions to ensure your system is assembled

      easily and safely using the 3T (Through The Trapdoor) method.



      The law requires that personnel erecting, dismantling or altering towers must be competent. Any

      person erecting a BoSS mobile tower must have a copy of this guide. For further information on

      the use of mobile access and working towers, consult the PASMA operatorsâ€˜ code of practice.

  - heading: Preparation & Inspection
    body: >-
      Inspect the equipment before use to ensure that it is not damaged and that
      it functions properly.

      Damaged or incorrect components should not be used.
  - heading: Safe Use
    body: >-
      * Check that all components are on site, undamaged and that they are
      functioning correctly - (refer to Checklist and Quantity Schedules).
      Damaged or incorrect components should not
        be used.
      * Check if the ground on which the mobile access tower is to be erected and moved is capable
        of supporting the tower.
      * The safe working load is 275 kgs (606lbs) per platform level, uniformly distributed up to a
        maximum of 950kgs (2100lbs), per tower (including self weight).
      * Towers must always be climbed from the inside using the built-in ladder during assembly
        and use.
      * It is recommended that towers should be tied to a solid structure when left unattended.

      * Adjustable legs should only be used for levelling.
  - heading: Lifting of Equipment
    body: >-
      * Tower components should be lifted using a reliable lifting material
      (e.g. strong rope), employing a reliable knot (e.g. clove hitch), to
      ensure safe fastening and always lift within the footprint of the tower.

      * Assembled mobile towers.
  - heading: Stabilisers/Ballast
    body: >-
      * Stabilisers or outriggers and ballast weights should always be fitted
      when specified.

      * The Quantity Schedules show the recommended stabilisation. In circumstances where there is restricted ground clearance for stabilisers/outriggers, contact your supplier for advice. Ballast must be made up of solid materials (i.e. not water or loose sand) and should not be positioned to overload individual legs. Ballast should be secured against accidental removal where practicable, and be supported on the lowest rung of the bottom frame.
  - heading: Movement
    body: >-
      * The tower should only be moved by manual effort, and only from the base.

      * Beware of live electrical apparatus when moving the tower (particularly overhead), plus wires
        or moving parts of machinery.
      * No person or materials should be on the tower during movement.

      * Caution should be exercised when wheeling a tower over rough, uneven or sloping ground, taking care to unlock and lock castors. If stabilisers are fitted, they should only be lifted a maximum of 25mm above the ground to clear ground obstructions.

      * The overall height of the tower when being moved should not exceed 2.5 times the
        minimum base dimensions, or 4 metres overall height.
      * Before use, check that the tower is still correct and complete.

      * After every movement of the tower, use a spirit level to check that it is vertical and level and
        set the adjustable legs as required.
      * Do not move the tower in wind speeds over 7.7 metres per second (17mph).
  - heading: During Use
    body: "* Beware of high winds in exposed, gusty or medium breeze conditions. We
      recommend that in wind speeds over 7.7 metres per second (17 mph), cease
      working on the tower and do not attempt to move it. If the wind becomes a
      strong breeze (expected to reach 11.3 metres per second - 25 mph) tie the
      tower to a rigid structure. If the wind is likely to reach gale force
      (over 18 metres per second - 40 mph), the tower should be dismantled."
