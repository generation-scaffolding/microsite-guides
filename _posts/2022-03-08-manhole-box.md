    body: "Health and safety legislation states that construction equipment users
      should formulate a site\r

      specific Safe System of Work to undertake any work they are
      planning. This guide was designed\r

      to offer basic instruction of Shoring Equipment Systems including
      the assembly, installation and\r

      extraction of the Manhole Box, including the Manhole and Backhoe
      Manhole Boxes. The correct\r

      sizes and weights of the components will also be shown so that use
      of equipment can be planned\r

      ahead. It is necessary that users enforce the appropriate safety
      practices of excavations and\r

      trenching throughout installation.


      The users of Shoring Equipment should be familiar, confident and
      competent when handling\r

      and installing boxes and accessories. Altrad Generation Hire & Sale
      excavation systems can be\r

      supplied with a full range of additional safety products including
      ladder access and guardrails as\r

      well as various other ancillary products. These products are
      designed to act in accordance with\r

      the practice of Shoring Equipment and meet the requirements of the
      Lifting Operations & Lifting\r

      Equipment Regulations, Work at Height Regulations and the Confined
      Spaces Regulations.


      Personnel should make themselves aware that certain conditions such
      as the close proximity\r

      of structures, site roads, railways and excavated materials near the
      trench can all increase\r

      surrounding earth pressures. If in doubt please seek advice.


      For additional details please contact your local Altrad Generation
      Hire and Sale Branch."

      - paragraph: Lower the second panel, pockets facing downwards onto the upraised
          struts you have just installed and lock in place.
        heading: "5."
        image: /assets/images/uploads/manhole-assembly-005.png
      - paragraph: Stand the Manhole Box upright on its cutting edges, by attaching
          chains to the downwards facing panel’s lifting points and turn the
          constructed Manhole Box from flat to upright.

        paragraph: Dig the trench
        image: /assets/images/uploads/manhole-install-001.jpg
      - heading: "2."
        paragraph: Lift the Manhole Box into the starter hole.

        image: /assets/images/uploads/manhole-install-004.png
      - paragraph: Push each corner in turn until the box reaches the limit. Install
          edge protection and ladder access. Enter excavation once safety is
          declared.

    body: ""
  - heading: Adding a Top Box
    body: "1) Fit the panel connectors to the top box\r

      2) Lift the box so these panel connectors hang down\r

      3) Locate the panel connectors in the top of the panel\r

      4) Then pin through connectors and panel\r

      5) Secure with these with ‘R’ Clips\r

      6) Repeat stage 4 and 5 until required depth

      \n"
  - heading: Extraction
    body: >-
      Extraction is the reverse of installation. Ensure that the trench is
      backfilled before lifting each corner in turn until box is at least 300mm
      above ground level, then attach 4 Leg Chain and lift box from the
      excavation.


      **A.** Attach a Snatch Chain to one lifting point and pull vertically. Repeat this for each corner.


      **B.** The next stage is to connect all four legs of the lifting chain and lift vertically.


      ![](/assets/images/uploads/manhole-extraction.png)
  - body: >-
      * Please refrain from using the box on unstable ground and within close
      proximity to structures
        due to increase in Earth Pressure.
      * Plan all excavations ahead of time to ensure that the correct lifting operations can be used.

      * Ensure that all personnel required to install this equipment are suitably trained and supervised
        whilst assembly and installation is in progress.
      * Inspect all components, including lifting points, struts, clips and pins.

      * Boxes should never be left ﬂying above the base of the excavation.

      * Leave 100mm of the box above ground level on the base/top box.

      * Refrain from bearing weight with the bucket in the middle of the panel during installation.

      * Only access the box via ladder access.

      * Never move the box whilst personnel are inside the excavation.

      * Do not use any un-supported part of the trench as access.

      * Top Boxes and extension panels are not to be removed before the top of the base box is above
        ground level.
      * To minimise damage do not lift the box via the struts or laterally load them.

      * Attach Ladder Access and Guardrails before use.

      * Seek advice if you are in doubt.
