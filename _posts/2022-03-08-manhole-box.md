### Introduction

Health and safety legislation states that construction equipment users should formulate a site specific Safe System of Work to undertake any work they are planning. This guide was designed to offer basic instruction of Shoring Equipment Systems including the assembly, installation and extraction of the Manhole Box, including the Manhole and Backhoe Manhole Boxes. The correct sizes and weights of the components will also be shown so that use of equipment can be planned ahead. It is necessary that users enforce the appropriate safety practices of excavations and trenching throughout installation. 

The users of Shoring Equipment should be familiar, confident and competent when handling and installing boxes and accessories. Altrad Generation Hire & Sale excavation systems can be supplied with a full range of additional safety products including ladder access and guardrails as well as various other ancillary products. These products are designed to act in accordance with the practice of Shoring Equipment and meet the requirements of the Lifting Operations & Lifting Equipment Regulations, Work at Height Regulations and the Confined Spaces Regulations. 

Personnel should make themselves aware that certain conditions such as the close proximity of structures, site roads, railways and excavated materials near the trench can all increase surrounding earth pressures. If in doubt please seek advice.
