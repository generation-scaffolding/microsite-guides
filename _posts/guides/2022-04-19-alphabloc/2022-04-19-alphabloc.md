      The uniquely foldable design allows for quick and easy deployment of the
      barrier.


      Stand over the barrier, take hold of the bracing lock and push down to separate the feet. Ensure bracing lock is pushed fully down into the lock position. After use , pull up on the bracing lock until the barrier has returned to the closed position.

      To link multiple barriers together, place the end of the barrier that has
      an aperture over the upstand on the end of the next barrier. The acute
      angled barrier design allows for multiple configurations on both flat and
      uneven surfaces.

      For increased stability, place a hose into the aperture and fill it with
      water. There is one aperture for filling on each side of the barrier.



      To empty, lift the end of the barrier furthest from the filling aperture and rest on the ground until the water ceases to flow.
