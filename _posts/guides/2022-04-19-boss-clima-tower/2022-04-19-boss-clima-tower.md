      BoSS mobile aluminium towers are light-weight scaffold towers used throughout the building and

      construction industry for both indoor and outdoor access solutions, where a stable and secure

      platform is required. Ideal for maintenance and installation work or short-term access, the highly

      versatile towers provide a strong working platform for a variety of heights.



      This User Guide provides you with step by step instructions to ensure your system is assembled

      easily and safely using the 3T (Through The Trapdoor) method.



      The law requires that personnel erecting, dismantling or altering towers must be competent. Any

      person erecting a BoSS mobile tower must have a copy of this guide. For further information on

      the use of mobile access and working towers, consult the PASMA operatorsâ€˜ code of practice.

  - heading: Preparation & Inspection
    body: >-
      Inspect the equipment before use to ensure that it is not damaged and that
      it functions properly.

      Damaged or incorrect components should not be used.
  - heading: Safe Use
    body: >-
      * Check that all components are on site, undamaged and that they are
      functioning correctly - (refer to Checklist and Quantity Schedules).
      Damaged or incorrect components should not
        be used.
      * Check if the ground on which the mobile access tower is to be erected and moved is capable
        of supporting the tower.
      * The safe working load is 275 kgs (606lbs) per platform level, uniformly distributed up to a
        maximum of 950kgs (2100lbs), per tower (including self weight).
      * Towers must always be climbed from the inside using the built-in ladder during assembly
        and use.
      * It is recommended that towers should be tied to a solid structure when left unattended.

      * Adjustable legs should only be used for levelling.
  - heading: Lifting of Equipment
    body: >-
      * Tower components should be lifted using a reliable lifting material
      (e.g. strong rope), employing a reliable knot (e.g. clove hitch), to
      ensure safe fastening and always lift within the footprint of the tower.

      * Assembled mobile towers.
  - heading: Stabilisers/Ballast
    body: >-
      * Stabilisers or outriggers and ballast weights should always be fitted
      when specified.

      * The Quantity Schedules show the recommended stabilisation. In circumstances where there is restricted ground clearance for stabilisers/outriggers, contact your supplier for advice. Ballast must be made up of solid materials (i.e. not water or loose sand) and should not be positioned to overload individual legs. Ballast should be secured against accidental removal where practicable, and be supported on the lowest rung of the bottom frame.
  - heading: Movement
    body: >-
      * The tower should only be moved by manual effort, and only from the base.

      * Beware of live electrical apparatus when moving the tower (particularly overhead), plus wires
        or moving parts of machinery.
      * No person or materials should be on the tower during movement.

      * Caution should be exercised when wheeling a tower over rough, uneven or sloping ground, taking care to unlock and lock castors. If stabilisers are fitted, they should only be lifted a maximum of 25mm above the ground to clear ground obstructions.

      * The overall height of the tower when being moved should not exceed 2.5 times the
        minimum base dimensions, or 4 metres overall height.
      * Before use, check that the tower is still correct and complete.

      * After every movement of the tower, use a spirit level to check that it is vertical and level and
        set the adjustable legs as required.
      * Do not move the tower in wind speeds over 7.7 metres per second (17mph).
  - heading: During Use
    body: >-
      * Beware of high winds in exposed, gusty or medium breeze conditions. We
      recommend that in wind speeds over 7.7 metres per second (17 mph), cease
      working on the tower and do not attempt to move it. If the wind becomes a
      strong breeze (expected to reach 11.3 metres per second - 25 mph) tie the
      tower to a rigid structure. If the wind is likely to reach gale force
      (over 18 metres per second - 40 mph), the tower should be dismantled.

      * Beware of open ended buildings, which can cause a funnelling effect.

      * Do not abuse equipment. Damaged or incorrect components should not be used.

      * Raising and lowering components, tools, and/or materials by rope should be conducted
        within the lower base. Ensure that the safe working load of the supporting decks and the
        tower structure is not exceeded.
      * The assembled tower is a working platform and should not be used as a means of access or
        egress to other structures.
      * Beware of horizontal forces (e.g. power tools) which could generate instability. Maximum
        horizontal force 20kg.
      * The stairway towers, (featuring an inclined staircase access) are for frequent use by
        personnel carrying tools and/or materials.
      * Mobile towers are not designed to be suspended - please refer to your supplier for advice.

      * Do not use boxes or stepladders or other objects on the platform to gain extra height.
  - heading: Ties
    body: >-
      * Ties should be used when the tower goes beyond its safe height, beyond
      the limits of the stabilisers/outriggers or if there is a danger of
      instability. They should be rigid, two way ties
        fastened to both uprights of the frame with load-bearing right angled or swivel couplers. Only
        couplers suitable for the 50.8mm diameter tube of the tower should be used. Ideally, ties
        should be secured to both faces of a solid structure by means of anchorages.
      * The tie frequency may vary depending on the application, but they should (at a minimum) be
        every 4 metres in height.
      * For further information on tying-in a tower please contact your supplier or BoSS.
  - heading: Maintenance - Storage - Transport
    body: >-
      * All components and their parts should be regularly inspected to identify
      damage; particularly
        to joints. Lost or broken parts should be replaced, and any tubing with indentation greater
        than 5mm should not be used and put to one side for manufacture repair. Adjustable leg
        threads should be cleaned and lightly lubricated to keep them free running.
      * Brace claws, frame interlock clips, trapdoor latches and platform windlocks should be
        regularly checked to ensure they lock correctly.
      * Refer to the BoSS Userguide for detailed inspection and maintenance advice.

      * Components should be stored with due care to prevent damage.

      * Ensure components are not damaged by excessive strapping forces when transported.

    body: >-
      ![](schedule-1-copy.png)


      IMPORTANT: Please ensure you also read the other Quantity Schedules

      *If you are unable to position the working platform easily from the ground, you may heighten. Requires an additional fixed platform for this tower weight


      ![](schedule-2-copy.png)
  - heading: Number Of Working Platforms Allowed
    body: >-
      The maximum safe working load (the combined weight of the users, tools and
      materials) that may be placed on the tower is the total weight less than
      the self weight of the tower. The total weight for the towers shown in the
      schedule is 950kg.


      **Example 1:**

      A 1450 tower built using the 3T method with a 4.2m platform height and a platform length of 1.8m has a self weight of 180kg.



      950kg - 180kg = 770kg maximum safe working load

      total weight self weight (users, tools and materials)


      **Example 2:**

      A 1450 tower built using the 3T method with a 11.7m platform height and a platform length of 2.5m has a self weight of 449kg.



      950kg - 449kg = 501kg maximum safe working load total weight self weight (users, tools and materials)



      For greater heights and loads, consult BoSS for guidance.
  - heading: Platform Loading
    body: >-
      On a 1450 tower, a platform may comprise of a single deck or two decks
      placed side by side. The maximum safe working load (the combined weight of
      the users, tools and materials) that may be

      placed on a platform is 275kg. This must be evenly distributed over either one deck, or two decks

      placed side by side.



      The quantities on within the 1450 Width Tower Quantity Schedule will enable BoSS towers to be built safely and therefore comply with the requirements of the Work at Height Regulations. They include double guardrails to all platforms. Toeboards will need to be added if any levels are used as working platforms and for storage of materials. EN 1004 requires platforms at least every 4.2m, and these measures will exceed that requirement.
