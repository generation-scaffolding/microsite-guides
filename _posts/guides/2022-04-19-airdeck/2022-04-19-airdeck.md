      Installers should adhere to all current Health and Safety Rules, such as
      the wearing of protective clothing, ie hard hat, high visibility
      Vest/Jacket, metal toe capped boots and hand protective gloves.

      AirDeck products are tested to the requirements of PAS59 safety standard.
    imageSteps:
      - heading: "1:"
        paragraph: Ensure the area is free from debris. Layout the AirDeck bags to allow
          for complete floor coverage. One bag when inflated measures 750mm x
          750mm x2100mm (WxHxD) and covers 1.6 m2. 50 bags, for example, will
          cover 80m2.

          Make sure that the inflator is ready for use and that the battery is
          fully charged.


          Three green lights on the charger indicate that the battery is charged to its maximum.

        heading: "3:"
        paragraph: Open the access flap and expose the valve. Remove the screw cap.
      - heading: "4:"
        paragraph: Insert the Inflator through the valve and inflate with the Inflator
          at maximum.

      - heading: "5:"
        paragraph: Fully inflate the liner until it completely fills the outer. The
          pressure regulator on the blower will ensure that the AirDeck is not
          overinflated.

        image: airdeck_non-return-flap.jpg
        paragraph: >-
          Once the liner is full of air, make sure the non-return flap is well
          seated, and then screw the cap

          on tightly.
      - heading: "7:"
        image: airdeck_flap-closed.jpg
        paragraph: On full inflation of the AirDeck, make sure that the liner does not
          protrude and that the flap will close fully to protect the liner.
      - heading: "8:"
        image: airdeck_access-overlap-flap.jpg
        paragraph: Should this not be the case, deflate the liner slightly and adjust by
          pulling the liner through the access overlap flap at the far end of
          the liner.
      - heading: "9:"
        image: airdeck_add-more-bags.jpg
        paragraph: >-
          Add more bags by following Steps 1-7 and clip them together. If the
          bags are not constrained by outer walls and are being used in an open
          situation, use bags with clips both top and

          bottom to ensure no movement of the bags
      - heading: "10:"
        image: airdeck_cover-floor.jpg
        paragraph: Cover the whole floor area. Clip the last bag in the row to its
          neighbour before inflating further bags. If necessary, partly inflated
          bags can be squeezed into small or awkward gaps.
      - heading: "11:"
        image: airdeck_deflate.jpg
        paragraph: >-
          To deflate the bags remove the valve screw cap. Push back the flap
          using the red tab until it locks in position. Using the extract
          facility on the pump, if it has one, draw out all the air.

          Alternatively, the bags will deflate rapidly if the valve is just left open.
      - heading: "12:"

        paragraph: >-
          Make sure the bags are fully deflated and then fold for on-site
          storage. Take care to

          store the bags and liners in a protected environment
